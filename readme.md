# ❄ Icebreaker

A plugin to add custom icebreakers to a WordPress site. 

- Adds icebreaker as a custom post type.
- Allows you to add multiple icebreakers in one go.
- Includes an icebreaker block which you can insert into any page or post.
  - The block will pick a random icebreaker and insert into the page/ post. 
  - There is a refresh button which will allow you to re-pick the icebreaker
    ( just incase you don't like the first choice. )

>
>### 👉  `npm start`
>- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
>- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.
>
>### 👉  `npm run build`
>- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
>- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.
>
>### 👉  `npm run eject`
>- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
>- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
>- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
>- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
